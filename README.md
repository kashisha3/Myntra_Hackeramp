# Myntra_Hackeramp

We have integrated four following features with the myntra website:
1. Virtual Try-on
2. Checking the sustainability of the product
3. Integrating the instagram posts with Myntra products
4. Games to improve the user engagement

The drive link to the virtual-try out features is: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VY59EkVLuFxoW00GNC5eubsRJqidiAnc?usp=sharing
(The drive link is uploaded because the unity and AR folder/files are of 6 gb and git has limit, even after using git lfs we are not able to push such huge folder)
